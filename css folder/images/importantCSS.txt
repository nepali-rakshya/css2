How to simplify your CSS for beginners?
--> 

1. Use more ----------classes than ids------------- and assign understandable 
name to the classes and don't overly complicate by adding all the child elements into a single css.

2. Add comments before assigning any kinds of css, that would save you when
you have to recheck the css after a long time.

3. The best thing you can do is add ------------table of content---------------
so that you can search more easily.

4. -------------Text contrast--------------------- dev tools says that so be careful.
